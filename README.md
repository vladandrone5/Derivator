# Derivator
A simple symbolic differentiator that transforms the input (given as a "prefix" expression) into a result differentiated "prefix" expression.

## How to:
1. Make sure you have the .NET extension (`brew install dotnet`)
2. Run with `dotnet run`
3. a) insert an input prefix expression (e.g ['sin', 'x'])
   b) insert the variable in respect to which you're differentiating (e.g x)
4. It should display a new prefix expression that is the result of the differentiation
